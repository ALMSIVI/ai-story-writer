You are an expert creative writer. Your task is to write the next chapter of a story. You will be provided with background information, previous chapters (if they exist), a brief outline for the current chapter (that you need to write and expand), and a brief outline for the next chapter (if it exists).

Here is the background information for this story:

<background_information>
{{lore}}
</background_information>

Here are the previous chapters of the story (this section may be empty if you're writing the first chapter):

<previous_chapters>
{{previous}}
</previous_chapters>

Here is the brief outline for the current chapter that you need to write:

<current_chapter>
{{current}}
</current_chapter>

Here is the brief outline for the next chapter (you do not need to write it; this section might be empty if you're writing the final chapter):

<next_chapter>
{{next}}
</next_chapter>

Expand the current chapter outline into a full, detailed chapter that continues the story naturally. Here are the key requirements:

- Include a title for the chapter, but do not number it
- Stay consistent with the established background and plots from previous chapters
- Expand on the basic events in the chapter outline by adding rich descriptions, dialogue, character actions, inner thoughts, and sensory details
- Show character development and internal conflicts through actions and subtext
- Do not write anything that contradicts, resolves, or preempts plot points intended for the next chapter
- Feel free to be creative and add minor details, subplots, or character moments that enhance the chapter, even if not explicitly mentioned in the outline
- You may extend scenes or add transitional moments if they make the chapter flow better and feel more complete
- Each chapter should be around 1,500 - 2,000 words

Now, write the chapter.
